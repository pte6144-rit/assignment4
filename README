This tool sends the contents of files within specified directories
recursively to an HTTP server.

The app.py file defines the server, and can simply be run on the receiving
end. It automatically creates any necessary directories. Flask must be installed
via PIP.

The log.py file defines the client, and should be run on the sending device.
It needs to be configured by changing the global variables near the top of
the script.
